	abstract = {Gray market emerges when the retailer diverts product from a lower-price market to a higher-price market without the manufacturer's permission. Internet of Thing (IoT) technology enables the manufacturer to track gray-product distribution and monitor gray market activity. In this paper, we aim to introduce IoT technology into gray market management and investigate the impact of IoT technology on gray market and firms' profits. First, we design an IoT-based traceability system which realizes the real-time monitoring of gray market activity. Based on the IoT-based traceability system, then we consider the manufacturer's two coping strategies and establish three game models to examine how IoT technology affects gray market and firms’ profits. Finally, we present the numerical simulations to perfect and supplement our findings. We find that IoT technology has significant implications which can inhibit gray market. However, it is not always beneficial to the manufacturer or harmful to the retailer. If the manufacturer takes an appropriate coping strategy, a win-win situation can be achieved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

It also identifies the role of collaborative innovation as a catalyst in these relationships. Survey data from Japanese manufacturing companies was examined using hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test the study's hypotheses. According to the results, collaborative innovation with SC members, that is, suppliers and customers, strengthens the impact of digital transformation on adaptability, but not on efficiency. In contrast, collaborative innovation with market participants, such as competitors and partners, reinforces the positive relationship between digital transformation and efficiency, with no evidence supporting its effect on the innovation-adaptability relationship. These findings encourage firms to widen the scope of their collaborative innovation activities to include different types of partners. For firms with limited abilities to conduct such complex collaboration projects, the findings can assist managers in making well-informed decisions to include partners that accommodate prioritized organizational goals. © Abdalla, S., Nakagawa, K. 2021.

We conduct an in-depth systematic review of IS literature on the topic and identify six debates central to how organizations realize value from big data, at different levels of analysis. Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features of big data that influence value realization: portability and interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data. We synthesize the findings by means of an integrated model.}

ABSTRACT = {The introduction of information technology into all aspects of our lives has brought forth qualitative and quantitative changes on such a large scale that this process has come to be known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0. The aim of this paper is to fill in the gaps and provide an overview of studies dealing with Industry 4.0 from the business and economic perspectives. A scoping review is performed regarding business, microeconomic and macroeconomic economic problems. Four investigators performed a literature search of the Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct. The selected period spanned from 2014 to 2018, and the following keywords were used for the search: Industry 4.0, economics, economic development, production economics, and financial sector. A total of 2275 results were returned. In all, 67 full papers were screened. Results obtained from the relevant studies were, furthermore, divided into the following categories: work and skills development; economy growth and macroeconomic aspect; sustainability; intelligent manufacturing; policy; and change in business processes. Findings show that the aspects of work and skills development, smart technology adoption, intelligent manufacturing, and digitalization are very well described. The government and its policies usually play the role of a needed supportive element. Usually studies lack a coherent view of the topic in question and solve partial questions.},

abstract={The advent of the Industry 4.0 initiative has made it so that manufacturing environments are becoming more and more dynamic, connected but also inherently more complex, with additional inter-dependencies, uncertainties and large volumes of data being generated. Recent advances in Industrial Artificial Intelligence have showcased the potential of this technology to assist manufacturers in tackling the challenges associated with this digital transformation of Cyber-Physical Systems, through its data-driven predictive analytics and capacity to assist decision-making in highly complex, non-linear and often multistage environments. However, the industrial adoption of such solutions is still relatively low beyond the experimental pilot stage, as real environments provide unique and difficult challenges for which organizations are still unprepared. The aim of this paper is thus two-fold. First, a systematic review of current Industrial Artificial Intelligence literature is presented, focusing on its application in real manufacturing environments to identify the main enabling technologies and core design principles. Then, a set of key challenges and opportunities to be addressed by future research efforts are formulated along with a conceptual framework to bridge the gap between research in this field and the manufacturing industry, with the goal of promoting industrial adoption through a successful transition towards a digitized and data-driven company-wide culture. This paper is among the first to provide a clear definition and holistic view of Industrial Artificial Intelligence in the Industry 4.0 landscape, identifying and analysing its fundamental building blocks and ongoing trends. Its findings are expected to assist and empower researchers and manufacturers alike to better understand the requirements and steps necessary for a successful transition into Industry 4.0 supported by AI, as well as the challenges that may arise during this process.},  keywords={},

The importance of human–machine interfaces (HMIs) has been increasing due to the complexity of the current manufacturing context. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and understand HMIs in smart factories from a holistic perspective, which enables us to understand the overall picture. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of HMIs to identify smart factory functions, tasks, information types, interaction modalities, and their impact on human operators from the perspectives of human factors and human–computer interaction. Seventy-seven articles were selected for SLR and analysed based on three research questions. We found four smart factory functions (operation and supervision, management, maintenance service, and cybersecurity) consisting of 18 tasks, including subtasks and functions. The effects of these functions, tasks, and HMIs on human operators are also discussed. Five interaction modalities (gaze, voice, gesture, tactile, and haptic) were used to perform these functions and tasks. This paper also discusses the practical use context of HMIs in smart factories and offers HMI recommendations for users, designers, and researchers. These findings provide insights into the design of HMIs in smart factories.}

However, we need to consider security inherent in existing (stand-alone) devices and networks as well as those that may arise in such integrations. Especially the existing solutions are insufficient to address these fundamental security concerns. Thus, we present a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication, BSeIn, to enforce fine-grained access control polices. The proposed system (with integrated attribute signature, multi-receivers encryption and message authentication code) is designed to provide privacy and security guarantees such as anonymous authentication, auditability, and confidentiality. BSeIn also scales well due to the utilization of smart contract. We then evaluate the security and performance of BSeIn. For example, findings from the performance evaluation demonstrate that Initialization/Request Issuance/Chain Transaction/State Delivery/Permission Update phase only cost 12.123/4.810/6.978/0.013/2.559s, respectively.}

The present paper describes the context of the extension of mechatronic systems to cyber-physical ones, firstly by highlighting their similarities and differences, and then by underlining the current needs for CPSs in the manufacturing sector. Then, the paper presents the main research issues related to CPS design and, in particular, the needs for an integrated and multi-scale designing approach to prevent conflicts across different design domains early enough within the CPS development process. To this aim, the impact of the extension from mechatronic to Cyber-Physical Systems on their design is examined through a set of existing related modelling techniques. The multi-scalability requirement of these techniques is firstly described, concerning external/internal interactions, process control, behaviour simulation, representation of topological relationships and interoperability through a multi-agent platform, and then applied to the case study of a tablets manufacturing process. Finally, the proposed holistic description of such a multi-scale manufacturing CPS allows to outline the main characteristics of a modelling-simulation platform, able notably to bridge the semantic gaps existing between the different designing disciplines and specialised domains.}

abstract="Systems do not simply pop into existence. They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to ``normal accidents.'' We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin.",

ABSTRACT = {The manufacturing sector is one of the areas where the advantages of digital twin technology can benefit mostly. The product development, including its software, electronics, mechanics, and physical behavior, is included in the digital twin of the product. Furthermore, simultaneous data capturing from the sensors and data processing are also available in the digital twin. This enables each phase of the development cycle to be simulated, processed, and validated to discover the potential problems before the production of real components. In this study, the use of digital twin technology in the commercial production phase of the automotive production line with a case study is introduced. This study is one of the most comprehensive studies in the literature related to automotive production; therefore, it puts forth the power of using digital twin technology in that area. As the result of this case study, a 6.01 percent increase in the commercial production line efficiency and an 87.56 percent gain for downtime are achieved.},

    abstract = "{The Digital Twin concept represents an innovative method to monitor and predict the performance of an aircraft’s various subsystems. By creating ultra-realistic multi-physical computational models associated with each unique aircraft and combining them with known flight histories, operators could benefit from a real-time understanding of the vehicle’s current capabilities. One important facet of the Digital Twin program is the detection and monitoring of structural damage. Recently, a method to detect fatigue cracks using the transformation response of shape memory alloy (SMA) particles embedded in the aircraft structure has been proposed. By detecting changes in the mechanical and/or electromagnetic responses of embedded particles, operators could detect the onset of fatigue cracks in the vicinity of these particles. In this work, the development of a finite element model of an aircraft wing containing embedded SMA particles in key regions will be discussed. In particular, this model will feature a technique known as substructure analysis, which retains degrees of freedom at specified points key to scale transitions, greatly reducing computational cost. By using this technique to model an aircraft wing subjected to loading experienced during flight, we can simulate the response of these localized particles while also reducing computation time. This new model serves to demonstrate key aspects of this detection technique. Future work, including the determination of the material properties associated with these particles as well as exploring the positioning of these particles for optimal crack detection, is also discussed.}",

A prerequisite of the translation process is a foundation suitable for training the practitioners of new methodologies. The members of the Living Heart Project aim to serve a translational role for the adoption of computational modeling and simulation into cardiovascular medicine and ultimately provide the scientific and evidentiary foundation for the use of such tools in medical practice. We describe the unique features of the Living Heart Project that enable it to pursue this goal and further, by way of select application examples, demonstrate that it should be possible to develop a robust heart simulation platform with sufficient breadth as to establish a foundation for virtual training with the realism found today in modern pilot training systems.",

First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

RFID devices are deployed systematically on the shop-floor to track and trace manufacturing objects and collect real-time production data. Disturbances are identified and controlled within RT-MES. Planning and scheduling decisions are more practically and precisely made and executed. Online facilities are provided to visualize and manage real-time dynamics of shop-floor WIP (work-in-progress) items. A case study is reported in a collaborating company which manufactures large-scale and heavy-duty machineries.

  abstract={Untimely or uncontrolled release of work orders into production creates variance in production and in turn leads to high work-in-process and increased average throughput time, high conversion rate and unbalanced production line. In the HMLV manufacturing environment (e.g. Precision Engineering industry), the massive product mix, low production quantity, and the multitude of production constraints make it virtually impossible for human beings to manually optimise the correct product mix to be released to the production. In this paper, a work order release system was implemented to bridge the gap between the enterprise planning and shop floor execution. It facilitates the management of the sales order by generating and releasing the work orders into shop floor, considering the finite capacity constraints. It also communicates with the shop floor tracking system during execution of the work orders. Working together, these two systems facilitate the management of unplanned stochastic and dynamic events.},

Additionally, we propose a general algorithm to extract some scene understanding by inverting the monoplotting process and applying it to digital elevation models. This allows us to derive estimations of perspective image areas causing object occlusions. Connecting the real world and perspective spaces, we can create a resilient object tracking environment using both coordinate spaces to adapt tracking methods when objects encounter occlusions. We submit that this novel composite of techniques opens avenues for more intelligent, robust object tracking and detailed environment analysis using GIS in complex spatial domains provided video footage and UAS products.},

              shop-floor management. However, reports on how such potentials
              come true in real-life shop-floor daily operations are very
              limited. As a result, skeptics overwhelm enthusiasm. This paper
              contributes to the re-vitalization of RFID efforts in
              manufacturing industries by presenting a real-life case study of
              applying RFID for managing material distribution in a complex
              assembly shop-floor at a large air conditioner manufacturer. The
              case study discusses how technical, social and organizational
              issues have been addressed throughout the project within the
              company. It is hoped that insights and lessons gained be
              generalized for future efforts across household electrical
              appliance manufacturers that share similar shop-floor.},

  abstract={Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an integral part of our life, which increases productivity and convenience. It is the term coined for short-range radio technology used to communicate mainly digital information between a stationary location and a movable object or between movable objects. This RFID system uses the principle of modulated backscatter where it can transfer the data from the tag to the reader. The tag generally reads its internal memory of stored data and changes the loading on the tag antenna in a coded manner corresponding to the stored data. RFID is a technology, which spans systems engineering, software development, encryption etc., and thus there are many engineers involved in the development and application of RFID and at present the shortage of technical and business people trained in RFID is hampering the growth of the industry.},

As RFID technology is widely adopted in the industries, the valuation of RFID investment has become vital for businesses due to its potential impacts on cost, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Because of the lack of analytical methods for measuring the benefits and costs, our study attempts to develop a mathematical approach to the valuation of RFID investment. This study presents the base model for RFID investment decisions in a supply chain management setting and enhances the model to help make budget allocation decisions for businesses with multiple sites under budgetary constraints.

This paper specifically explores the impact of such developments on manufacturing shop floor control, examining the way in which both conventional control methods and so-called distributed, intelligent control methods can be enhanced by the availability of accurate, timely information about an item. In the case of distributed, intelligent manufacturing control we begin to build a specification for the concept of an intelligent product—a product whose information content is permanently bound to its material content and which is able to influence decisions made about it.}

	abstract = {This edition of Digital Image Processing is a major revision of the book. As in the 1977 and 1987 editions by Gonzalez and Wintz, and the 1992, 2002, and 2008 editions by Gonzalez and Woods, this sixth-generation edition was prepared with students and instructors in mind. The principal objectives of the book continue to be to provide an introduction to basic concepts and methodologies applicable to digital image processing, and to develop a foundation that can be used as the basis for further study and research in this field.

To achieve these objectives, we focused again on material that we believe is fundamental and whose scope of application is not limited to the solution of specialized problems. The mathematical complexity of the book remains at a level well within the grasp of college seniors and first-year graduate students who have introductory preparation in mathematical analysis, vectors, matrices, probability, statistics, linear systems, and computer programming. The book website provides tutorials to support readers needing a review of this background material.

One of the principal reasons this book has been the world leader in its field for 40 years is the level of attention we pay to the changing educational needs of our readers. The present edition is based on an extensive survey that involved faculty, students, and independent readers of the book in 150 institutions from 30 countries. The survey revealed a need for coverage of new material that has matured since the last edition of the book. The principal findings of the survey indicated a need for:

New material related to histogram matching.
Expanded coverage of the fundamentals of spatial filtering.
A more comprehensive and cohesive coverage of image transforms.
A more complete presentation of finite differences, with a focus on edge detection.
A discussion of clustering, superpixels, and their use in region segmentation.
New material on active contours that includes snakes and level sets, and their use in image segmentation.
Coverage of maximally stable extremal regions.
Expanded coverage of feature extraction to include the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).
Expanded coverage of neural networks to include deep neural networks, backpropagation, deep learning, and, especially, deep convolutional neural networks.
More homework problems at the end of the chapters.
MATLAB computer projects.
The new and reorganized material that resulted in the present edition is our attempt at providing a reasonable balance between rigor, clarity of presentation, and the findings of the survey. In addition to new material, earlier portions of the text were updated and clarified. This edition contains 425 new images, 135 new drawings, and 220 new exercises. For the first time, we have included MATLAB projects at the end of every chapter. In total there are 120 new MATLAB projects that cover a broad range of the material in the book. Although the solutions we provide are in MATLAB, the projects themselves are written in such a way that they can be implemented in other languages. Projects are an important addition because they will allow students to experiment with material they learn in the classroom. A large database of digital images is provided for this purpose.},

The correspondence between the resulting cubic spline functions and Gaussian functions was first shown by Poggio. The impulse response arising from cubic spline approximation is however not positive everywhere. As an alternative, approximating cubic splines under tension are considered in this paper and a fast implementation is proposed that requires the same amount of calculations for all values of the spread. The performance (approximation error versus computational efficiency) is compared with that of single- and multi-stage FIR Gaussian filter approximations.
Zusammenfassung
Eine angenäherte Gauβsche Filterung äquidistanter Daten kann über eine Regularisierung der Daten mit Hilfe Tikhonovs stabilisierenden Funktionalen zweiter Ordnung erreicht werden. Poggio hat zuerst den Zusammenhang zwischen kubischen Splines und den Gauβ-Funktionen herausgestellt. Die Impulsantwort, die man bei der Approximation mit kubischen Splines erhält, ist jedoch nicht überall positiv. Als Alternative werden kubische Splines unter Spannung betrachtet und eine günstige Implementierung bei gleichem Rechenaufwand vorgeschlagen. Die Güte (Approximationsfehler gegen Rechenaufwand) wird mit ein- bzw. mehrstufigen Gauβschen Filterapproximationen verglichen.
Résumé
Le filtrage gaussien approché de données équidistantes peut être obtenu en régularisant les données avec les fonctionnelles de stabilisation de deuxième ordre de Tikhonov. La correspondance entre les fonctions splines cubiques et les fonctions gaussiennes a été montrée pour la première fois par Poggio. La réponse impulsionnelle découlant de l'approximation par spline cubique n'est toutefois pas positive partout. Comme alternative, on considère dans cet article des splines cubiques d'approximation, tendues, qui nécessitent le même nombre de calcul pour toutes les valeurs de l'étendue. La performance (l'erreur de l'approximation en fonction de l'efficacité de calcul) est comparée avec celles d'approximations par filtres gaussiens à un ou plusieurs niveaux.}

  abstract={This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},
