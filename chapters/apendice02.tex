\chapter{Summary of the Technical Drawings and Developed Codes}
\label{apendice2}

In this appendix, the Section~\ref{appendice:technicalDrawings} illustrates the technical drawings regarding the development of the 3D device through the SolidWorks software.

Already, for the Section~\ref{appendice:code}, it provides the link for the GitHub, where the user can find the documents developed. The files are divided as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{api} file contain all the Appication Program Interface developed using PHP programming language.
    \item Already for the \textit{application} file, it gives the access to the Front End application, where can be found the HTML/CSS and JavaScript codes.
    \item In \textit{esp32\_code} file, it is found the code structure developed using Arduino IDE in C programming language.
\end{itemize}
