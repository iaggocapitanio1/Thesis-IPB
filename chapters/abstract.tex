The development of a traceability solution for furniture components using Fiware will involve the integration of various processes within an IoT platform. This will allow for the seamless tracking and tracing of furniture components from the point of production to the final consumer. By leveraging the power of IoT, we will be able to collect and analyze real-time data from various points along the supply chain, providing valuable insights and enabling the efficient management of the traceability process. Additionally, the use of an IoT platform will enable us to easily integrate our solution with other existing systems, allowing for a more seamless and efficient overall supply chain. Overall, the integration of processes within an IoT platform will be a key component of our traceability solution for furniture components.
