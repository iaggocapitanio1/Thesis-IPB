Hereby I would like to thank everyone who in a certain way contributed, directly or indirectly, to the development of this work.

Firstly, to my supervisor at Polytechnic Institute of Bragança (IPB), Professor Dr.~João Paulo Coelho, for all the support, guidance and advice during the course of this work. I am very grateful for all the experience I had, my eternal thanks!

To my supervisor at the Federal University of Paraná (UTFPR), professor Dr.~André Luiz Regis Monteiro, for the support, transmitted knowledge and good talks, especially when I was still in Brazil.

To my home university, UTFPR, for the opportunity to participate in the Dual Diplomacy program. I would never have had the opportunity to meet such nice people from all over the world without it. 

To my family and friends, especially to my mother and grandparents, who were always encouraging and motivating me. Nothing could be done without them.

Finally, a special thanks to Eric and Ighor, who for sure will be at my wedding one day... My eternal thanks for all the moments "gained" together.
